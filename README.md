# Gartic Notifier

Gartic Notifier is an experimental tool which the main functionality is notifying you when your friends login in Gartic. It's a proof of concept that I decided to develop it to gather some practical informations about polling gartic server with continously http requests, in order to better decide if it's worth developing an Android application that notifies the user when its gartic friends login their accounts.
